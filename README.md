Solutions to the problems over at [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about)!

I figure working through them will help me (a) get back into mathematics and practice my language-agnostic problem solving, and (b) learn new languages/keep from getting rusty with more familiar languages. As such, only sometimes is the focus on _not simply brute forcing the problem_. It depends what I'm most interested in thinking about at the time.

Note: I'm not allowed to share solutions beyond problem #100, so I'm afraid this fun will have to stop there... :D
